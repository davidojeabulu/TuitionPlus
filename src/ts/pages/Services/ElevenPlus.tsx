        From the beginning of year 4, we provide an in-depth, robust course in
        preparation for the <strong>11+ selection tests</strong> that take place
        in year 6.
      </p>
      <p>
        This involves two lessons per week, in groups of 6-8, covering the
        subjects Mathematics, Verbal Reasoning, Non-Verbal Reasoning and
        English.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of the lessons are to provide students with a solid foundation
        and equip them with all the skills necessary to succeed in their 11+
        examinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides 11+ entrance examinations, we also provide preparation support
        for <strong>Independent School</strong> entrance tests, such as:
